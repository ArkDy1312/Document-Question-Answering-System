All these movies was great and I seen each and every one of them.

What are the generations of the autobot

There are two main gentartion of autobot.

Which are broken down simply as gentarion-one and gentartion-two.

The two groups are the series of autobot that came out for that time period. So the first generation of autobot was created from 1984 to 1992.

And then the second generation was created from 1992-1995.

How many transformer are there.

This is really a hard number to find because there was many different versions of the same type of autobot. In the tv series there was about 31 transformer categories.

This is between the autobots and the decepticons. These categories are broken down into the different titles that was given to the transformer.

From things like Autobot cars, mini-bots,Dinobot,Protectobot and the list continues. Thereâ€™s over 100 different type of transformer.

Some of the main characters are Optimus Prime which is the strongest and most courageous of all the Autobots and heâ€™s the leader.

Bumblebee is the small, eager and the brave of the autobot. Heâ€™s one of the smaller autobot and he idolize optimus Prime.

Cliffjumper is eagerness and one of the fastest autobot. Wheeljack is the mad scientist and wrecker. He invents the new weapons and gadgets.

Some of the deceptions main character are, Megatron he combines brute strength, military ruthlessness and terror. Soundwave can hear the impossible with his great hearing ability.

Shockwave he has a laser gun that can emit lethal beams of energy from anywhere
on the electromagnetic spectrum. Thundercracker can fly at a speed up to 1550 mph.

Whatâ€™s the difference between autobot and decepticons

The main different that I have gathered from watching all the movies.

Is that Autobot is a group of transformer that is trying to save the earth.

While deceptions on the other hand is trying to destroy it. Both Autobot and Decepticon are strong in their own way.

Autobot are the superheroes of the transformers and decepticons are the evil villains. They both are from the planet cybertron.

All of the Decepticons have red eyes which is the biggest factor to tell the two transformer apart.

Because the autobot eyes are blue. They both have the ability to transform from a robot into a different thing.

Who is the most powerful autobot

Of course the most powerful Autobot what have to be the leader of the whole Autobot which is Optimus Prime.

Optimus Prime is the most powerful one of the whole Autobot team. Not only is he more powerful than all of them.

He has a better mindset as the leader, he will put his life on the line to save the Autobot Transformers team.

Thatâ€™s what make him a great leader and the most powerful one.

So whoâ€™s going to be in line with me when the new Transformer movie comes out?
